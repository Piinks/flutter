/// A sliver widget implementing the iOS-style pull to refresh content control.
///
/// When inserted as the first sliver in a scroll view or behind other slivers
/// that still lets the scrollable overscroll in front of this sliver (such as
/// the [CupertinoSliverNavigationBar], this widget will:
///
///  * Let the user draw inside the overscrolled area via the passed in [builder].
///  * Trigger the provided [onRefresh] function when overscrolled far enough to
///    pass [refreshTriggerPullDistance].
///  * Continue to hold [refreshIndicatorExtent] amount of space for the [builder]
///    to keep drawing inside of as the [Future] returned by [onRefresh] processes.
///  * Scroll away once the [onRefresh] [Future] completes.
///
/// The [builder] function will be informed of the current [RefreshIndicatorMode]
/// when invoking it, except in the [RefreshIndicatorMode.inactive] state when
/// no space is available and nothing needs to be built. The [builder] function
/// will otherwise be continuously invoked as the amount of space available
/// changes from overscroll, as the sliver scrolls away after the [onRefresh]
/// task is done, etc.
///
/// Only one refresh can be triggered until the previous refresh has completed
/// and the indicator sliver has retracted at least 90% of the way back.
///
/// Can only be used in downward-scrolling vertical lists that overscrolls. In
/// other words, refreshes can't be triggered with [Scrollable]s using
/// [ClampingScrollPhysics] which is the default on Android. To allow overscroll
/// on Android, use an overscrolling physics such as [BouncingScrollPhysics].
/// This can be done via:
///
///  * Providing a [BouncingScrollPhysics] (possibly in combination with a
///    [AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics]) while constructing the scrollable.
///  * By inserting a [ScrollConfiguration] with [BouncingScrollPhysics] above
///    the scrollable.
///  * By using [CupertinoApp], which always uses a [ScrollConfiguration]
///    with [BouncingScrollPhysics] regardless of platform.
///
/// In a typical application, this sliver should be inserted between the app bar
/// sliver such as [CupertinoSliverNavigationBar] and your main scrollable
/// content's sliver.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// When the user scrolls past [refreshTriggerPullDistance],
/// this sample shows the default iOS pull to refresh indicator for 1 second and
/// adds a new item to the top of the list view.
///
